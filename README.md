# Carbon Tax Perception Analysis in Indonesia

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes public perceptions of the carbon tax policy in Indonesia using a clustering approach. The objective is to identify distinct groups of respondents and understand their perspectives on the effectiveness, implementation, and impact of the carbon tax across various sectors.

## 🔍 Key Findings

The analysis reveals four distinct clusters of respondents, each reflecting diverse viewpoints on the carbon tax policy:
- General Agreement on Effectiveness
  Most respondents believe that the carbon tax is effective in reducing carbon emissions and contributes positively to:
  -- Environmental protection
  -- Public health improvement

Infrastructure development

Implementation Challenges
Despite overall support, respondents emphasize the need for:

More intensive public outreach and education

Improvements in the taxation system

Clearer policy communication

Economic and Incentive Considerations
Many respondents highlight the importance of:

Tax incentives for businesses

Increased investment in clean and renewable energy technologies

Diverging Opinions
There are notable differences across clusters regarding:

Appropriate carbon tax rates

Application of the tax across different industrial sectors

The potential economic impact on industries

📊 Methodology

Analytical Approach: Clustering Analysis

Purpose: Segment respondents based on their perceptions of the carbon tax

Outcome: Identification of four respondent clusters with distinct policy views

🎯 Insights & Implications

The results suggest that while public support for the carbon tax exists, successful implementation depends on:

Transparent communication

Fair and sector-sensitive tax design

Strong incentives for sustainable business practices

These insights can support policymakers in refining carbon tax strategies to balance environmental goals and economic sustainability.
